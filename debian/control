 ktrace is a kernel call tracer, i.e. a debugging tool which prints out
 a trace of all the kernel calls made by a another process/program.
 .
 Kernel calls and signals are events that happen at the user/kernel
 interface. A close examination of this boundary is very useful for bug
 isolation, sanity checking and attempting to capture race conditions.

Description: The OpenBSD Packet Filter
 Packet Filter (from here on referred to as PF) is OpenBSD's system for
 filtering TCP/IP traffic and doing Network Address Translation. PF is also
 capable of normalizing and conditioning TCP/IP traffic and providing
 bandwidth control and packet prioritization.

 This version of PF has been ported to FreeBSD by the FreeBSD project, and
 subsequently to GNU/kFreeBSD by the Debian project.

Package: powerd
Priority: standard

Package: mkuzip
Priority: extra
Section: misc
Architecture: kfreebsd-any
Depends: ${shlibs:Depends}, ${misc:Depends}
Replaces: freebsd-utils (<< 8.2+ds3-3)
Description: Disk image compression utility
 The mkuzip utility compresses a disk image file so that the geom_uzip(4) class
 will be able to decompress the resulting image at run-time. This allows for a
 significant reduction of size of disk image at the expense of some CPU time
 required to decompress the data each time it is read.
